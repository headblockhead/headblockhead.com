                            <p>This is the first game I ever made. In this "game" you type in a number and then another number, select a symbol and wait for 10 seconds whilst the cat "thinks". They will then tell you the answer. I was very proud of this creation and even made a youtube video on it, but that was sadly lost due to a careless reformat of my old laptop's hard drive.</p>
